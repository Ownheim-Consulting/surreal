# Public API
This API is currently hosted publicly using Google Cloud. If you would like to hit this endpoint without needing
to install or build the project you can access the API at the following URL:

`https://space-app-364302.uc.r.appspot.com/api/google-cloud/filename/2020_pcp.png`

The data will be returned in the following format:
```
{
    "callbackUrl": "...",
    "filename": "..."
}
```

The `callbackUrl` field is a signed URL from Google Cloud that is valid for 1 hour. With this URL you can download and view the visualizations.

You can change the final parameter to a variety of file names in order to see multiple different data sets visualized.
